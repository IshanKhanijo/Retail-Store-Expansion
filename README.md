# Retail Store Market Expansion

## Project Overview
This project uses spatial analysis to identify high-potential retail zones in Australia. It includes data cleaning, hotspot detection, market potential scoring, and opportunity mapping to guide strategic business decisions.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**  
   - Removed duplicates, validated coordinates, and filtered for Australian locations.  
   - Used data from [OpenStreetMap](https://onemap-esri.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/988071da24954be5b250a5d2a6bc6cab_0/about) and [Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)](https://www.abs.gov.au/methodologies/data-region-methodology/2011-24#data-downloads).  

2. **Hotspot Detection:**  
   - Identified high-density retail clusters in major cities like **Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane** using spatial density analysis.  

3. **Catchment Analysis:**  
   - Created **10 km buffer zones** around hotspots to understand store reach and reduce overlap.  

4. **Market Potential Scoring (MPS):**  
   - Calculated **Market Potential Scores** based on factors like **population, employment, working-age population,** and **spending power**.  

5. **Opportunity Mapping:**  
   - Identified **high-MPS, low-density** zones ideal for **new store launches** or regional hubs.

2. **Retail Store Density in Australia**  
3. **Retail Store Hotspots in Australia**  
4. **Market Potential by Catchment Area (sq km)**  
5. **High Market Potential Zones (MPS > 10)**  
6. **High-Potential, Low-Density Zones**
